                        <p>At KIIN (Key-In) we started with a simple goal, to create the clothing staples you will always need, in a way that you've NEVER seen before.  Goals are great, but we also wanted to make sure that we were creating clothes in a manner we felt was responsible; both for you our consumer, and for the planet.  We seem to be living in a culture of waste and excess,  two drives we wanted no part of. Instead we wanted to build clothes that will be worn, and worn regularly, and we wanted them to last!  If our BODYGUARD undershirt or boxer-briefs ends up at the back of your closet, or worse yet, a landfill, we have failed.  We want you to consume less, and enjoy more.  We want your clothes to last longer, and fit better.

                        <p>No part of your wardrobe is closer to your body than your underwear.  Obvious? Yes.   And yet this seemingly simple idea is lost on so many.  Common sense is no longer common.  We believe that the pinnacle of comfort is achieved when you don't feel like you're wearing anything at all.</p>
                        
                        <p>After years of testing and experimentation we believe we have achieved this goal.  By using Bemis® Bonding technology, our proprietary fabric and innovative design, our undergarments feel as though they're not even there.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our Ultra-Low Profile design, made without even a single stitch being sewn, means that in addition to feeling like they're not there, our undergarments are practically invisible under your clothes as well.  </p>
